##  Endowing third-party libraries recommender systems with explicit user feedback mechanisms: Replication package

This repository contains the needed file to replicate the experiments conducted in the paper. Furthermore, we include the data and results of [CrossRec](https://github.com/crossminer/CrossRec), the TPLs recommender systems used as the baseline. 



## Folder structure 

The folder is structured as follows:
```
 	|--- dataset		It contains the CrossRec dataset and results						
	|
	|--- LTR 		This folder stores the results of the positive/negative feedback as well as the LTR implementation
	|					
	|--- additive_tool   	It contains the implemented tool to support additive user feedback on top of CrossRec
```
